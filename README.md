# AWS-EC2
Struggling to create an EC2 instance? In this repository, I will guide you to create an EC2 instance within 4 seconds. The only prerequisite is to have an AWS account. If you don't have one, create an account using the AWS Free Tier: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SetUp/latest/UserGuide/setup-AWSsignup.html.
